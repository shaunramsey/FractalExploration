Take note: some of these images are rendered to unreasonabe sizes for the sake of exploring the limitations of the program and image viewers.

Tips:

- If you have a detacated graphics processor try to force your image viewer to use that. In my case I have a laptop with an iGPU(Intel processor based graphics) and a dGPU(an Nvidia card)
    I forced my image viewer to use the Nvidia card which helped with loading times.
- If you zoom in a program like Microsoft photos, give the program time to process it, it may take some time for the image to show up in place of just a blank background
